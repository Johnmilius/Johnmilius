Hello! My name is John Milius. I'm a student at BYU-Idaho, expeceted to graduate around spring 2027.

I started my journey in the computer science realm in highschool being interesting in creating simple programs using the Java Language. That grew over time over many years into my passion for computers and programming. I have made several hardware projects building my own computers on top of creating many programming projects. 

As I've learned more about the programming world I have lead an interest towards Data Engineering and Architecture. 

## Skills
**Languages:** Python • C# • JavaScript • SQL • HTML + CSS 
**Data & Storage:** Relational DBs • SQL schema design • Normalization • Firebase • json 
**Tools:** VS Code • Git • Docker • MySql Workbench
