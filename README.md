## Hello! My name is John Milius.

I'm a student at BYU-Idaho, expeceted to graduate around spring 2027.

I began my journey in computer science back in high school, where I became fascinated with creating simple programs in Java. Over the years, that interest grew into a deeper passion for computers, programming, and system design. Along the way, I built multiple PCs, completed various hardware projects, and developed a growing list of software projects across different languages and technologies.

As I’ve gained more experience, my interests have increasingly shifted toward Data Engineering and System Architecture—designing reliable data flows, scalable backends, and structured systems that support real-world applications.

## Skills
**Languages:** Python • C# • JavaScript • SQL • HTML + CSS 
**Data & Storage:** Relational DBs • SQL schema design • Normalization • Firebase • json 
**Tools:** VS Code • Git • Docker • MySql Workbench

## Projects
**SkateMap:** A Deployed website that uses Json storage to handle the creation and updating of Skating spots on a leaflet map. Similar to Yelp but for skateboarding. 
**HomeServerSimulation:** A Python Socket client Server messing system that handles Command request from either home devices or a centralized console. 
**GymWorkoutDatabase:** USing MySQLWorkbench created a schema for a Gym Workout database with transactional tables. Saves peoples data of what excersise, reps, sets, and type of workout. 

## IN PROGRESS
**WarehouseSimulation:** A Full stack Project towards handling the inventory and stock of a warehouse that ships out products for other companies. Using MYSQL for the database along with Python scripts to query and anaylize data to create business reports and handle incomming orders into the most effecient picking, packing and sorting methods. 

## Currently Learning
- Database architecture & optimization  
- Backend design patterns 
- Building scalable data workflows  
- Connecting backend → frontend cleanly
- Datastructures and algorithms
